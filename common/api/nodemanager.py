<Purpose>
  This is the nodemanager api for clearinghouse.
  
  Unless you are are developing the backend server, all you will use this
  module for is to first call init_nodemanager() and then to call either of
  these two functions:
  
    * get_node_info()
    * get_vessel_resources()
  
  You will not be able to use any of the other functions in this module from
  most code because you will not have access to the private owner keys for the
  node. Only the backend should be accessing the private owner keys. That is,
  if you need to change the node state, use the backend api, not this api.
  
  Information for using the other functions:
  
  If you are developing the backend_daemon itself, then you have a legitimate
  reason to be calling the other functions in this module which can change the
  node state. To use those, you will first call init_nodemanager() and then do
  the following to use any of the functions that change node state:
  
    1. Call get_node_handle() to obtain a node handle that can be passed to
       the other functions in this module.
    2. Call any of the other functions in this module, passing the node handle
       as the first argument.
